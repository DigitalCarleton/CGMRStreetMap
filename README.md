2. Install the Walking Tour plugin with the standard Omeka procedure.

3. Configure the map settings by using the interactive map to select a new center or type the longitude and latitude value of the center you want separated by a comma, i.e. "longitude, latitude‚Äù. If you want the center of the map to be automatically calculated based off all geolocated items that have been added to walking tours, check the Auto-fit to Locations checkbox.
